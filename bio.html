            <h2 style="text-align:left">Why the ambition to be a game designer?</h2>
            <p>Focused on keeping the team organized throughout the event by ensuring people always had something to do. I focused on the menu's and all the content with them as I wanted to learn how to use the GUI system in Unity better.  I coniuned to work with the team and reworked the written dialog the team found lacking for the game.  </p>

            <h2 style="text-align:left">What qualifies me as a game designer?</h2>
            <p>Designing games is the art of constructing experiences and I had the fortune of traveling in my life.  The experience of meeting new people, making friends, going on adventures, and      finding new things to enjoy, these provides a strong background to draw from to enable the creation of engaging games.
              To be a great designer you need good communication skills, to work with a team of individuals with amazing ideas.  You must provide direction for the team while listening, considering their inputs and the respective costs and benefits of the implementation.  I spent four years as a Residential Assistant, which involved a lot of mediating/counselling of those within my building.  To effectively help those who sought me out, I learned how to really listen.  I needed to ensure that all sides were understood and understood how I weighted the options available before providing my advice.  Having experience in these matters has allowed me to develop communication skills that excel in cooperative environments.  </p>

            <h2 style="text-align:left">How did I get here?</h2>
            <p>Since high school, I have had a desire to create experiences.  The medium has not always been games; I was into acting and directing in high school. In university, I took a game design class and became entranced with the impact games have, and how I could be a creator.  Since then I have been improving all aspects that would be applicable to designing games.  I am making board games, video games, music, writing and art and  I will continue to improve my skill set.</p>
